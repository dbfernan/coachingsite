                Hello, I'm David -- Tennis has been one of my biggest passions for many years, and by using my knowledge of the sport and high-level competitive experience, I want to play a part in the stories of future generations in CNY through coaching! As I'm now attending Syracuse University, my days of Junior-level USTA tournaments and Varsity are over; however, I'm still playing and competing in various clubs/ leagues. I've continued to improve my game, especially on a mental level, and as a coach I aim to teach what I know about form, tactics, mentality, etc, all while having fun and developing passion for Tennis in new players!

                As a new coach in the area, I want players to have an accessible option to reach the next-level without having to break the bank -- Therefore, I'm currently charging just below minimum wage (prices subject to change over time)
